/*
Closures are probably the key-feature that
made Groovy so popular

A closure in Groovy is an open, anonymous, 
block of code that can take arguments, return 
a value and be assigned to a variable. A closure 
may reference variables declared in its surrounding 
scope. In opposition to the formal definition of a 
closure, Closure in the Groovy language can also 
contain free variables which are defined outside 
of its surrounding scope.
